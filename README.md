This is my website containing two pages for my fictional root beer brand 'Billy Beer', which is based on the real Billy Beer drink which was an alcoholic beverage instead. So far I have the Facts and Contact pages. The Facts page uses emojis to help describe the flavours that will be experienced when drinking a product from Billy Beer. The contact page is included as a requirement for this midterm.

All paragraphs I used were created with the help of chatgpt. The prompt I used is below.

To ChatGPT: "can you write 6 small paragraphs about a root beer drink called 'billy beer'. These paragraphs should each focus individuall on 1. sourness 2. Sweetness 3. Fizzyness 4. Tropical flavours 5. Mystery flavour 6. refreshment"
